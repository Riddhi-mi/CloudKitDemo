# CloudKitDemo

The CloudKit framework provides interfaces for moving data between your app and your iCloud containers. You use CloudKit to store your appâ€™s existing data in the cloud so that the user can access it on multiple devices.

## Requirements

Xcode 9+
iOS 11+

# Implementation

Here's the link to my blog for implementation of CloudKit and it's usage.


## Usage
Create a container to store records.
```swift
let container = CKContainer.default().publicCloudDatabase
```
## Create Record
To create a record to CloudKit Database, you also have to set value for a key like UserDefaults in cloudkit.
```swift
let record = CKRecord(recordType: "Title")
record.setValue("\(UUID())", forKey: "id")
record.setValue(title, forKey: "title")
container.save(record, completionHandler: { (record, error) in
 })
```

## Fetch Record
To fetch a record from CloudKit Database, you have to use a query of CKQuery type which takes predicate and RecordType as parameter and then you pass that query.
```swift
let predicate = NSPredicate(value: true)
let query = CKQuery(recordType: "RECORD_TYPE", predicate: predicate)
container.perform(query, inZoneWith:  CKRecordZone.default().zoneID, completionHandler: { (records, error) in
  })
```
If you want to fetch a single record you can fetch it using CKRecord.Id a unique identifier in CloudKit to distinguish between Records.
```swift
container.fetch(withRecordID: id) { record, error in
  }
```

or 

You can use query as well of CKQuery to query records.
```swift
let predicate = NSPredicate(value: true)
let query = CKQuery(recordType: "Title", predicate: predicate)
container.perform(query, inZoneWith:  CKRecordZone.default().zoneID, completionHandler: { (records, error) -> Void in
 })
```

## Delete Record
To delete a record from CloudKit Database. You have to pass in CKRecord.ID a unique identifier in CloudKit to distinguish between Records.
```swift
container.delete(withRecordID: record.recordID) { (recordID, error) -> Void in
 }
```

## Update Record
To update a record you have to update the record you have to fetch record using ID and then using the key update a newValue to it.
```swift
container.fetch(withRecordID: id) { record, error in
record?.setValue(NEW_TITLE, forKey: "title")
container.save(record, completionHandler: { (record, error) in
 })
}
```
or 

If you have created a unique identifier of string from yourself, you can use this as well!
```swift
let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "id == %@", id)
let query = CKQuery(recordType: "Title", predicate: predicate)
container.perform(query, inZoneWith:  CKRecordZone.default().zoneID, completionHandler: { (records, error) -> Void in
 })
}
```
